could be tweaked
    line of sight is limited to 3
    auto-pickup for items, but auto-use (food vs health) may not be good, save for later
    movement should be wasd-qezc with x as action. awkward in regular no isometric keebs
    posessed foxes drop gold? haha
    no way to check inventory or equip items
    V does something weird
    no save with ctrl-s
    on game start, no initial vision until blindly walking into  a direction
    sometimes getting a SOMETHING ELSE message
    "you go up the stairs" in first level but nothing happens
    if health gets low, it doesn't show
    no way to restart
    lots of corridors with single block exits, and nothing there to explore
    
ideas
    what if inflation (growing economy) was created by spelunking and finding gold
    automatically path to the exit if already found
    adventure mode with 3 lives
    trapped rooms triggered upon grabbing gold
